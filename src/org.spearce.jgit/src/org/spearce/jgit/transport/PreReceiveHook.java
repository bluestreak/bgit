/**
 * Hook invoked by {@link ReceivePack} before any updates are executed.
 * <p>
 * The hook is called with any commands that are deemed valid after parsing them
 * from the client and applying the standard receive configuration options to
 * them:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>receive.denyDenyDeletes</code></li>
 * <li><code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * This means the hook will not receive a non-fast-forward update command if
 * denyNonFastForwards is set to true in the configuration file. To get all
 * commands within the hook, see {@link ReceivePack#getAllCommands()}.
 * <p>
 * As the hook is invoked prior to the commands being executed, the hook may
 * choose to block any command by setting its result status with
 * {@link ReceiveCommand#setResult(ReceiveCommand.Result)}.
 * <p>
 * The hook may also choose to perform the command itself (or merely pretend
 * that it has performed the command), by setting the result status to
 * {@link ReceiveCommand.Result#OK}.
 * <p>
 * Hooks should run quickly, as they block the caller thread and the client
 * process from completing.
 * <p>
 * Hooks may send optional messages back to the client via methods on
 * {@link ReceivePack}. Implementors should be aware that not all network
 * transports support this output, so some (or all) messages may simply be
 * discarded. These messages should be advisory only.

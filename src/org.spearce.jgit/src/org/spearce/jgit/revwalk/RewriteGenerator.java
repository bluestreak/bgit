/**
 * Replaces a RevCommit's parents until not colored with REWRITE.
 * <p>
 * Before a RevCommit is returned to the caller its parents are updated to
 * create a dense DAG. Instead of reporting the actual parents as recorded when
 * the commit was created the returned commit will reflect the next closest
 * commit that matched the revision walker's filters.
 * <p>
 * This generator is the second phase of a path limited revision walk and
 * assumes it is receiving RevCommits from {@link RewriteTreeFilter},
 * after they have been fully buffered by {@link AbstractRevQueue}. The full
 * buffering is necessary to allow the simple loop used within our own
 * {@link #rewrite(RevCommit)} to pull completely through a strand of
 * {@link RevWalk#REWRITE} colored commits and come up with a simplification
 * that makes the DAG dense. Not fully buffering the commits first would cause
 * this loop to abort early, due to commits not being parsed and colored
 * correctly.
